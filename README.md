# Mathekalender 2021
## By Xandra Dick-Tinkelenberg
This is my first GitHub repository. To start with something different from usual, I will use the challenges from the [MATH+ Kalendar 2021](https://www.mathekalender.de/wp/). The last 4 years I participated in this adventkalendar with mathematical challenges.
> The calendar offers fascinating insights into recent application-oriented mathematical research and into the everyday professional life of mathematicians. 
> The 24 challenging puzzles are aimed at curious high school students, university students, teachers, and everyone interested.

This is a very primitive start, just the README.md, but it's a start :upside_down_face:
